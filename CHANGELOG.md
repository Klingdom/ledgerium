## [2026-04-12] - Agentic CI initialization

### Added
- `.claude/commands/improvement-loop.md` to run one bounded continuous-improvement iteration
- `.claude/templates/improvement_backlog_template.md` for ranked improvement backlog maintenance
- `.claude/templates/iteration_log_template.md` for repeatable iteration documentation
- `IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md` seeded with a ranked top-10 portfolio aligned to current Phase 1 priorities
- `ITERATION_LOG.md` initialized with iteration 000
- `SYSTEM_HEALTH.md` initialized with a current-state scorecard

### Changed
- improvement operations now have a deterministic scoring formula and one-item-per-loop rule
- system-level improvement work is now tracked through explicit operating artifacts instead of ad hoc session memory

### Notes
- no product code was changed in this initialization step
- the next step is to run the first true bounded improvement loop and implement exactly one selected item
