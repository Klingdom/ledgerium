## [2026-04-18] - Iteration 009: Playwright E2E tests + CI workflow (release blocker #1 closed)

### Added
- `apps/extension-app/playwright.config.ts` — **new file**, isolated Playwright config for the extension workspace (400×600 sidepanel viewport, `testMatch: recording-lifecycle.spec.ts`, CI-aware reporter/retries, single-worker sequential, 30s timeout). Does NOT couple to the existing `apps/web-app/playwright.config.ts` (Next.js / Prisma / auth-setup dependencies would fail outside the web-app context).
- `apps/extension-app/e2e/recording-lifecycle.spec.ts` — **new file**, 3 lifecycle tests using a static-harness approach:
  - **idle screen** — Start Recording button is disabled when activity name is empty (4 assertions)
  - **start recording** — typing activity name enables button; clicking transitions badge "Ready" → "Recording" + shows "Recording Active" banner (4 assertions)
  - **stop recording** — clicking "Stop & Review" transitions badge to "Complete" (2 assertions)
- `.github/workflows/e2e-extension.yml` — **new file**, 63 lines, single-job GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push/PR to `main`. Steps: checkout → pnpm/action-setup@v4 → setup-node@v4 with pnpm cache → `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` → cache Playwright browsers (keyed on pnpm-lock hash) → conditional `playwright install chromium --with-deps` → `pnpm --filter extension-app build` → `pnpm --filter extension-app test:e2e` → upload `playwright-report/` artifact on failure (7-day retention). Concurrency: cancel-in-progress on same ref. Timeout: 10 minutes.
- `apps/extension-app/package.json` — `"test:e2e": "playwright test"` script + pinned `@playwright/test@1.59.1` devDependency

### Test strategy: static-harness with real production bundle
- The built sidepanel (`dist/src/sidepanel/index.html`) is served via a local HTTP server from `beforeAll`
- A deterministic `chrome.*` mock is injected via `page.addInitScript` BEFORE React mounts, simulating the background service worker's state machine (GET_STATE response + SESSION_STATE_UPDATED broadcasts on START_SESSION / STOP_SESSION)
- Tests exercise the REAL production JS bundle (same code that ships in the extension) including `useRecorderState` and every sidepanel component — only the `chrome.runtime` transport layer is mocked
- Tradeoff: deterministic and fast, but does NOT test background/content script message handling or `chrome.storage` persistence. Real-extension `launchPersistentContext` tests deferred to iter 010+.

### Impact
- **Before**: release blocker #1 (E2E coverage) open for 8 loops; no automated regression protection for the sidepanel lifecycle; no test CI gate on PRs (only deploy.yml's quality-gate on push events)
- **After**: 3 lifecycle assertions auto-run on every push/PR to main; fast local reproduction (`cd apps/extension-app && pnpm test:e2e` → 4.7s); foundation for iter 010 session-recovery tests to extend this harness
- **Release-blocker burn rate**: 0/3 → **1/3 closed** in a single loop (Meta-Review 001's 1-in-5 cadence rule working as intended)
- **CI surface**: new `e2e-extension` workflow adds PR-blocking gate; expected ~60–90s warm-cache runtime, ~3–5min cold-cache
- **Agent diversity over last 5 loops**: 1 → **3** (backend-engineer + qa-engineer + devops-engineer — first non-backend-engineer implementation loop since iter 003)
- **Test counts**: Vitest stays at 1,512/1,512 (no regressions); E2E adds 3 new tests (first non-unit tests in repo history)

### Validation
- `pnpm typecheck` (monorepo) — clean across all 10 workspace projects ✅
- `pnpm test` (monorepo) — 1,512/1,512 pass across 41 files ✅
- `pnpm --filter extension-app test:e2e` — 3/3 pass in 4.7s ✅
- Workflow YAML parsed valid; action versions pinned (`@v4` across the board); line count 63 (within 40–100 scope-discipline target)
- Command sequence in workflow matches qa-engineer's handoff repro commands exactly

### Governance / selection signals
- Selected via `blocker-cadence` rule (1-in-5 release-blocker rotation, new in Meta-Review 001)
- Final score: 15 (Impact:4 + Alignment:5 + Learning:4 + Confidence:4 − Effort:3 − Risk:2 + release_blocker_bonus:3 − saturation_penalty:0) — highest post-formula score; would have been 12 under the old formula
- First iteration executed under the refined Selection Policy; first post-Meta-Review-001 loop
- Scope discipline preserved: no unit-test CI, no lint CI, no typecheck CI, no web-app E2E, no `launchPersistentContext` — all queued as follow-ups

### Release blocker resolved
- "E2E Playwright lifecycle tests missing" — closed after 8 loops. Remaining release blockers: session event persistence (iter 010), LiveStepBuilder ↔ StreamingSegmenter duplication (iter 011).

## [2026-04-17] - Iteration 008: Policy-engine integrated into content capture pipeline

### Changed
- `apps/extension-app/src/content/target-inspector.ts` — `isSensitiveTarget(el: Element): boolean` now delegates to `classifySensitivity` from `@ledgerium/policy-engine`, replacing the local `SENSITIVE_RE` regex and `SENSITIVE_INPUT_TYPES` set
- DOM-specific early returns preserved: `<input type="password">`, `<input type="hidden">`, and `autocomplete` containing "password" still short-circuit to `true` (cannot be checked string-side)
- String attributes (`id`, `name`, `data-testid`, `aria-label`, `type`) extracted from the Element and passed to the shared classifier — single source of truth for sensitivity patterns across capture time and normalization time
- Function signature unchanged: all 10 existing callsites in `content/capture.ts` work without modification

### Added
- `apps/extension-app/src/content/target-inspector.test.ts` — **new file**, 20 tests covering:
  - All pre-refactor behavior preserved (password, hidden, autocomplete, `name="password"`, `id="api_key"`, `data-testid="cvv-input"`, `name="ssn"`, etc.)
  - 3 new-coverage regression guards (`name="card_number"`, `name="social_security_number"`, `name="tax_id"`) that would fail if the old local regex were re-introduced
  - Smoke test for `inspectTarget()` to give the module baseline coverage
- Manual DOM mocks (no `happy-dom`/`jsdom` dependency added — monorepo stayed dependency-clean)

### Impact
- **Before**: capture-time used local 8-word regex; normalization used 12-pattern shared ladder. New patterns added to shared package never reached capture time.
- **After**: single source of truth. Newly-active sensitivity patterns in capture: `card_number`, `social_security_number`, `tax_id`, richer `credit_card` matching via the shared classifier's category ladder
- **Consolidation**: extension now imports from 4 workspace packages in the content layer (previously only `background/normalizer.ts` used `@ledgerium/policy-engine`)
- **Package / code consistency score**: 3.5 → 4
- **Test count**: 1,492 → 1,512 (+20)

### Notes
- **Known narrow regression** (documented in tests and backlog): aria-label `"Credit card number"` with literal spaces is no longer caught. The pre-refactor local regex used a loose `/credit/i`; the shared classifier uses `/credit[_-]?card/i` which requires `_` or `-` (not whitespace). Fix queued as iter 008 follow-up (score 11): widen shared regex to `/credit[\s_-]*card/i`.
- `content/capture.ts` NOT modified — the refactor is a drop-in replacement, and 10 intact callsites prove it.
- Extension content layer gets its first-ever unit tests via this iteration. Other content files (`capture.ts`, `state-observer.ts`, `label-extractor.ts`) remain untested and are added to SYSTEM_HEALTH top risks.

### Release blocker resolved
- "Shared capture-policy enforcement not fully integrated" — closed.

## [2026-04-17] - Iteration 007: SOP release-readiness quality gate (sopValidator)

### Added
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/sopValidator.ts` — new file exposing `validateRenderedSOP(rendered: RenderedSOP, output: ProcessOutput): SOPValidation` with 6 quality-rubric rules evaluated in declaration order
- Exported `validateRenderedSOP` and `SOPValidation` type from `@ledgerium/process-engine` public API (`templates/index.ts` + `src/index.ts`)
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/sopValidator.test.ts` — 31 tests covering every rule in isolation, parameterized banned-string coverage, first-match ordering, positive fixtures, and structured-error shape invariants

### Rules (first failure wins)
1. **banned_recorder_artifact** — scans rendered markdown for 8 strings from `TRANSFORMATION_RULES.md` §5.1 (`"Click the div"`, `"Click the span"`, `"Click the svg"`, `"Click the p"`, `"Click the li"`, `"Click the section"`, `"Interact with element"`, `"Perform action"`)
2. **too_few_steps** — requires `output.sop.steps.length >= 2`
3. **step_has_no_evidence** — every step must have `instructions.length > 0`
4. **empty_expected_outcomes** — no step may have a falsy `expectedOutcome`
5. **generic_title** — rejects `"Workflow N"`, `"Untitled Process"`, `"Untitled Workflow N"`
6. **prose_only_purpose** — rejects purposes starting with `"This SOP describes "`

Failures return structured `{ ok: false, reason, diagnostic, suggestion }` — the validator never throws. Throwing is the caller's policy decision.

### Impact
- Before: no programmatic quality gate existed; a bad recording could produce a rendered SOP containing raw recorder artifacts like `"Click the div"` that would reach users
- After: consumers of `@ledgerium/process-engine` have a single zero-dependency function to call before publishing a rendered SOP; 6 anti-patterns from `QUALITY_RUBRIC.md` §10 are now detectable in one pass
- Test count: 1,461 → 1,492 (+31)

### Notes
- **Integration into `processSession.ts` deferred** per the one-item-per-loop rule. The dev-throws/prod-logs guard policy is a separate concern tracked as a follow-up backlog item (score 11).
- **Spec reconciliation**: `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` Gap #8 (lines 182–186) listed 7 banned strings and omitted `"Click the section"`. `TRANSFORMATION_RULES.md` §5.1 is the authoritative source and lists 8. Implementation follows §5.1 — the IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md snippet is a doc gap, flagged for future doc sync.
- `processSession.ts` NOT modified — existing pipeline behavior preserved.

## [2026-04-17] - Iteration 006: Per-step confidence glyph in rendered SOPs

### Added
- `confidence?: number` optional field on `OperatorSOPStep`, `EnterpriseSOPStep`, `DecisionSOPAction` interfaces (additive, non-breaking)
- `formatConfidenceGlyph(confidence: number | undefined): string | undefined` helper in `renderHelpers.ts` with named glyph constants (`STEP_CONFIDENCE_HIGH_GLYPH = '●'`, `STEP_CONFIDENCE_MEDIUM_GLYPH = '◐'`, `STEP_CONFIDENCE_LOW_GLYPH = '○'`)
- Three-tier classification reusing the document-level confidence thresholds (`HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.85`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.70`) now exported from `sopTemplates.ts` to ensure document- and step-level tiers cannot drift apart
- 25 new tests across 5 describe blocks in `templates.test.ts` covering glyph selection boundaries, percentage rounding, undefined handling, and per-template population across all four Decision branch patterns

### Changed
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/sopTemplates.ts` — all three template builders now populate `confidence: step.confidence` per step (including all four DecisionSOP action patterns)
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/markdownRenderer.ts` — all three render functions emit the confidence glyph line directly after the evidence row:
  - `● High confidence (92%)` for confidence ≥ 0.85
  - `◐ Medium confidence (78%)` for 0.70 ≤ confidence < 0.85
  - `○ Low confidence (54%) — review manually` for confidence < 0.70

### Impact
- Before: low-confidence and high-confidence steps rendered identically; reviewers had no inline signal for which steps to audit
- After: every step that has a confidence score shows its tier glyph with the explicit `— review manually` advisory on low-confidence steps
- **SOP trust-signal trifecta complete**: document-level badge (iter 004) + per-step evidence (iter 005) + per-step confidence (iter 006) — the three core visible signals from Design System §7.3
- Test count: 1,436 → 1,461 (+25)

### Notes
- Thresholds are single-sourced from `sopTemplates.ts` to prevent tier drift. This creates a benign circular import (`renderHelpers.ts → sopTemplates.ts → renderHelpers.ts`) that resolves cleanly via ESM hoisting because the shared values are primitive constants. Queued as a low-effort follow-up (extract to shared constants module) — backlog item score 10.
- Scope discipline: no other trust signals added in this loop (e.g., no per-step risk markers, no sensitivity flags).

---

## [2026-04-17] - Iteration 005: Per-step evidence references in rendered SOPs

### Added
- `evidenceEvents?: string[]` optional field on `OperatorSOPStep`, `EnterpriseSOPStep`, `DecisionSOPAction` interfaces (additive, non-breaking)
- `formatEvidenceRow(eventIds: string[]): string | undefined` helper in `renderHelpers.ts` with named truncation constants (`MAX_EVIDENCE_IDS = 8`, `EVIDENCE_TRUNCATION_HEAD = 5`)
- 17 new tests across 6 describe blocks in `templates.test.ts` covering helper unit tests, per-template evidence rendering, empty/undefined suppression, and truncation

### Changed
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/sopTemplates.ts` — all three template builders now populate `evidenceEvents` per step from `step.instructions.map(i => i.sourceEventId)`
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/markdownRenderer.ts` — all three render functions emit `◦ Evidence: N events · ev_XX, ev_YY` per step (with correct singular/plural; omitted when empty; truncated to first 5 + `…+N more` over 8 IDs)

### Impact
- Before: source event IDs existed in the underlying `SOPStep.instructions[].sourceEventId` data but never surfaced in rendered output; readers had no per-step traceability without traversing internal data structures
- After: every step in every rendered SOP shows its evidence line immediately below the expected-outcome row, matching the approved `docs/sop/examples/01_operator_centric_example.md` aesthetic
- Combined with iter 004: rendered SOPs now surface confidence at the document level AND evidence at the step level — both core visible trust signals from `docs/sop/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- Test count: 1,419 → 1,436 (+17)

### Notes
- Scope was deliberately narrowed to `evidenceEvents` only. Adjacent fields from broader IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES lists (`confidence`, `isSensitive`, `durationLabel`, `risks`, `branchType`, `probability`, `metadata`, `evidenceManifest`) are explicitly out of scope per the one-item rule and are now tracked as follow-up backlog items.
- Truncation cap chosen: 8 full IDs, then first 5 + `…+N more`. Constants are named in `renderHelpers.ts` for future tunability.

## [2026-04-17] - Iteration 004: SOP metadata strip + confidence badge above the fold

### Added
- `docs/sop/` — 14-artifact world-class SOP framework delivered by sop-expert agent (design system, canonical schema, transformation rules, quality rubric, 3 template specs, 3 rendered reference examples, implementation notes, collaboration requests). All examples trace to a shared 28-event `source_recording.json` for deterministic traceability proof.
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/renderHelpers.ts` — `renderMetadataStrip()`, `renderEnterpriseMetadataTable()`, `renderConfidenceBadge()` helpers
- `qualityBadge()` classifier exported from `sopTemplates.ts` with `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `HIGH_BADGE_MAX_LOW_STEPS`, `LOW_BADGE_MIN_LOW_STEPS` constants
- 26 new test cases in `templates.test.ts` across 6 describe blocks covering helpers, classifier, and above-the-fold position assertions for all three SOP templates

### Changed
- `packages/process-engine/src/templateTypes.ts` — added optional `qualityBadge?: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'`, `averageConfidence?: number`, `generatedAt?: string` fields to `OperatorSOP`, `EnterpriseSOP`, `DecisionSOP` (all additive, non-breaking)
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/sopTemplates.ts` — all three template builders populate the new metadata fields from `qualityIndicators`
- `packages/process-engine/src/templates/markdownRenderer.ts` — `renderOperatorMarkdown`, `renderEnterpriseMarkdown`, `renderDecisionMarkdown` restructured to emit H1 → italic purpose tagline → metadata strip → confidence badge as the first block

### Impact
- Before: rendered SOPs jumped from H1 directly into `## What This Is For`; generator credit only in footer; no confidence surfacing anywhere in the document
- After: first 15 lines of every rendered SOP contain H1, italic purpose, metadata strip (`Ledgerium SOP · v1.0 · N steps · M systems · X% confidence · Generated YYYY-MM-DD`), and confidence callout (`> ✓ High confidence` / `> ⚠ Medium confidence` / `> ⚠ Low confidence`)
- Customer-visible SOP output quality lifted to match approved `docs/sop/examples/` aesthetic
- Ledgerium's trust-first promise is now visible above the fold, not buried in metadata
- Test count: 1,393 → 1,419 (+26)

### Notes
- Interface changes are additive with safe defaults (`averageConfidence ?? 1`, `qualityBadge ?? 'high'`) — any caller still passing partial objects continues working
- Gap #2 (per-step evidence hoisting) and Gap #3 (sopValidator) from sop-expert's `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this iteration and are now top backlog items
- Decision SOP metadata strip uses `N paths` wording (vs `N steps`) to match decision template's target aesthetic

## [2026-04-16] - Analytics Next Steps: Alerting, missing tracking, upgrade instrumentation

### Added
- `GET /api/admin/alerts` — Evaluates 8 alert conditions (3×P1, 4×P2, 1×P3) against AnalyticsEvent table. Returns per-alert status (ok/firing/insufficient_data), thresholds, and summary counts.
- System Alerts section in admin analytics dashboard — shows firing alerts with severity badges, pulsing status dots, and "Show all" toggle for ok alerts. Green "All systems operational" banner when healthy.
- `trackServer('signup_completed')` in `/api/auth/signup` — server-side signup tracking for reliable funnel measurement
- `trackServer('extension_api_key_created')` in `/api/keys` POST — tracks extension setup milestone
- `trackServer('plan_limit_hit')` in `/api/upload` — was missing (only in `/api/sync`)
- `track('upgrade_prompt_viewed')` in `UpgradeCTA` component — fires once on mount with feature/plan context
- `track('upgrade_clicked')` and `track('checkout_started')` in `UpgradeButton` component — completes conversion funnel instrumentation

### Changed
- `/api/admin/cleanup-events` — replaced single `deleteMany` with batched deletion (1000 per batch) to avoid long table locks on large datasets

### Impact
- All 8 DASHBOARD_SPEC alerting conditions now evaluated via API
- Conversion funnel fully instrumented: upgrade_prompt_viewed → upgrade_clicked → checkout_started → subscription_created
- Server-side signup tracking ensures funnel accuracy even if client-side tracking fails
- Extension API key creation tracked for activation funnel measurement
- All 1,393 tests pass, typecheck clean

---

## [2026-04-16] - Analytics Phase 3: Admin dashboard enhancements, event cleanup, SOP survey

### Added
- `GET /api/analytics/engagement` — Computes 0-100 engagement scores for all users based on 8 weighted behavioral signals (workflows, SOP views, exports, shares, map views, analyses, login recency, org usage). Returns per-user breakdown and tier distribution (high/medium/low/inactive).
- `GET /api/analytics/retention` — Computes weekly cohort retention over last 8 signup weeks. Tracks % of users who uploaded workflows in weeks 0-4+ after signup, with average retention row.
- `GET /api/admin/cleanup-events` — Admin event retention management. Supports dry-run (count only) and purge modes with configurable retention window (7-3650 days, default 90).
- Enhanced admin analytics dashboard with 3 new sections: Engagement Score Distribution (tier tiles + user table), Retention Cohorts (heat-map table), Event Cleanup (check/purge UI)
- `SOPUsefulnessSurvey` component — Non-blocking in-app feedback prompt that appears after 30s on SOP tab. 4 response options: yes_as_is, minor_edits, major_rework, not_useful
- `sop_usefulness_response` added to AnalyticsEvent union type

### Impact
- Admin can now see per-user engagement scoring, identify churn risk, and track weekly retention cohorts
- Direct output quality signal collection via SOP usefulness survey (KPI-005 target: 50% yes+minor_edits)
- Event table can now be managed to prevent unbounded growth
- All 1,393 tests pass, typecheck clean

---

## [2026-04-16] - Iteration 003: Replace duplicated extension logic with workspace package imports

### Changed
- `apps/extension-app/src/shared/constants.ts` — Replaced local definitions of `SEGMENTATION_RULE_VERSION`, `IDLE_GAP_MS`, `CLICK_NAV_WINDOW_MS`, `RAPID_CLICK_DEDUP_MS` with re-exports from `@ledgerium/segmentation-engine`
- `apps/extension-app/src/shared/utils.ts` — Replaced local `extractDomain` and `deriveRouteTemplate` implementations with re-exports from `@ledgerium/normalization-engine`
- `apps/extension-app/src/background/normalizer.ts` — Replaced local `RAW_TO_CANONICAL` map with spread of `RAW_TO_CANONICAL_TYPE` from `@ledgerium/normalization-engine` + 3 extension-specific additions; replaced local `SENSITIVE_RE` and `isSensitive()` with `classifySensitivity()` from `@ledgerium/policy-engine`; imported `NORMALIZATION_RULE_VERSION` from package

### Impact
- Before: Extension declared 6 workspace packages as dependencies but imported from 0 of them in background/capture code. Normalization, segmentation constants, and sensitivity detection were duplicated locally.
- After: Extension imports from 3 workspace packages (`normalization-engine`, `segmentation-engine`, `policy-engine`). 6 constants, 2 utility functions, 1 type map, and 1 sensitivity function now use the single source of truth.
- Removed ~80 lines of duplicated logic
- Zero behavior change — all 1,393 tests pass, typecheck clean, extension builds successfully

### Notes
- Extension-specific items preserved: `normalizeUrl` (more secure — strips sensitive params + hash), `deriveAppLabel` (more app labels), 3 extra event type mappings (`context_menu`, `dropdown_opened`, `dropdown_closed`)
- Future iterations can address: LiveStepBuilder ↔ StreamingSegmenter convergence, full type unification, upstreaming extension-only improvements to packages

---

## [2026-04-15] - Iteration 002: CI quality gate

### Added
- `quality-gate` job in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — runs `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` before Docker build
- Job dependency chain: `quality-gate → build-and-push → deploy`
- Uses Node.js 20, pnpm 9, `--frozen-lockfile` install

### Impact
- Before: every push to `main` deployed to production with zero automated quality checks
- After: all 1,393 tests and full monorepo typecheck must pass before any deployment
- All existing and future test/type investments are now enforced on the deployment path

---

## [2026-04-14] - Phase F2+F3: Free/Starter + Team/Growth feature implementation

---

## [2026-04-13] - Phase F1: Tier-based feature gating foundation

### Added
- `apps/web-app/src/lib/plans.ts` — PlanType system, PLAN_FEATURES constant mapping all 5 tiers to 19 feature flags and limits (recordings, seats, recorders)
- `apps/web-app/src/lib/feature-gating.ts` — Server-side guards: requireFeature(), checkRecordingLimit(), buildFeatureFlags(), buildFeatureFlagsWithUsage()
- `TIER_FEATURE_ROADMAP.md` — Complete 4-phase roadmap for implementing all tier features (F1-F4)
- `FEATURE_GATING_DESIGN.md` — Architecture design for feature gating, Stripe multi-tier, client awareness

### Changed
- `apps/web-app/src/lib/stripe.ts` — Added STRIPE_PRICES for all 6 price IDs (3 tiers × monthly/annual), planFromPriceId() resolver, getPriceId() lookup
- `apps/web-app/src/app/api/billing/webhook/route.ts` — Resolves plan from Stripe price ID instead of hardcoding "pro"
- `apps/web-app/src/app/api/billing/checkout/route.ts` — Accepts plan + interval parameters, resolves correct Stripe price
- `apps/web-app/src/app/api/upload/route.ts` — Replaced hardcoded free limit with checkRecordingLimit() (monthly reset, all tiers)
- `apps/web-app/src/app/api/sync/route.ts` — Same recording limit fix as upload route
- `apps/web-app/src/app/api/account/route.ts` — Returns full feature flags, plan info, and usage limits
- `apps/web-app/src/lib/session.ts` — Removed PLAN_LIMITS constant, canUpload() now delegates to feature-gating

### Notes
- Legacy "pro" plan maps to "starter" via toPlanType() — no disruption to existing users
- Recording limits now use monthly count (uploads this calendar month) instead of cumulative uploadCount
- All 1,364 tests pass with zero regressions
- Phase F1 unblocks F2 (Free+Starter completion) and F3 (Team+Growth features)

---

## [2026-04-13] - Iteration 001: Web-app test infrastructure

### Added
- `apps/web-app/vitest.config.ts` — vitest configuration with `@/` path alias, proper include/exclude patterns
- `test` and `test:watch` scripts in `apps/web-app/package.json`

### Changed
- Web-app test files (`humanize.test.ts`, `format.test.ts`) are now discovered and executed by vitest
- Monorepo test count: 1,314 → 1,364 (+50 web-app tests now running)
- `IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md` updated with 5 new candidates from iteration 001 assessment
- `SYSTEM_HEALTH.md` test coverage score: 3 → 3.5

### Notes
- This was the first true bounded improvement loop (iteration 001)
- Selected item scored 16 (highest by 4 points over next candidate)
- Unblocks all future web-app test authoring: API route tests, component tests, integration tests

---

## [2026-04-12] - Agentic CI initialization

### Added
- `.claude/commands/improvement-loop.md` to run one bounded continuous-improvement iteration
- `.claude/templates/improvement_backlog_template.md` for ranked improvement backlog maintenance
- `.claude/templates/iteration_log_template.md` for repeatable iteration documentation
- `IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md` seeded with a ranked top-10 portfolio aligned to current Phase 1 priorities
- `ITERATION_LOG.md` initialized with iteration 000
- `SYSTEM_HEALTH.md` initialized with a current-state scorecard

### Changed
- improvement operations now have a deterministic scoring formula and one-item-per-loop rule
- system-level improvement work is now tracked through explicit operating artifacts instead of ad hoc session memory

### Notes
- no product code was changed in this initialization step
- the next step is to run the first true bounded improvement loop and implement exactly one selected item
