# Ledgerium AI — Claude Code Operating System

## Purpose

This repository is operated as an **agentic product system** that builds a
deterministic, evidence-driven SaaS platform.

The goal is not just to ship code.

The goal is to produce:
- working software
- measurable outcomes
- traceable system behavior

Use this file for **durable operating rules only**.

---

## Core Principles (Ledgerium)

- **Reality before opinion**
- **Evidence before interpretation**
- **Determinism before abstraction**
- **Traceability over convenience**
- **Measurable outcomes over feature output**
- **Small, reversible changes over large rewrites**

If a system is not:
- traceable
- testable
- measurable

→ it is NOT complete

---

## Product Context

Ledgerium AI is a **deterministic, evidence-linked process intelligence platform**.

System model:

Observed Behavior → Structured Events → Deterministic Processing → Process Intelligence

Core rules:
- Raw input data is immutable
- Transformations are deterministic
- Outputs must be traceable to source evidence

---

## Operating Model (Agentic Team)

This is a **multi-agent system**:

- Coordinator → sequences work
- Specialist agents → execute within roles
- Engineering agent → implements and enforces correctness

### Rules
- Do not do work outside your role
- Do not bypass upstream artifacts
- Do not invent requirements
- Always escalate gaps or contradictions

### Specialist-invocation gate (MR-005 Change D-4)

Two scope-shape signals MUST force specialist agent invocation as adjacent (not as deferred follow-up):

1. **User-visible copy changes.** When an iteration's scope includes rewriting, adding, or removing ≥3 user-visible strings (UI labels, chip copy, button text, error messages, empty-state copy, filter names), `growth-strategist` MUST be invoked as adjacent — not deferred. The adjacency is a lightweight consult (≤30 min brand-voice review) and does NOT scope-expand the primary iteration. Exception: bug fixes touching error-message wording in failure paths that already existed; these are engineering corrections, not copy changes.

2. **New-contract surface ≥200 LOC pure module.** When an iteration implements a new contract — pure module, deterministic primitive, or API layer — and the delivered surface exceeds 200 LOC (measured by the exported interface + public function bodies, not by test code), `system-architect` MUST be invoked as primary or adjacent. The adjacency ensures contract-level review happens BEFORE downstream iterations build on the surface. Exception: mechanical refactors that preserve existing contract byte-identically (extract-and-reexport patterns).

Both rules close the "deferred-as-follow-up" bypass pattern. A specialist review that happens post-iteration-close via Mode 3 correction is evidence the rule should have fired pre-iteration.

---

## Operating Modes

Each improvement-loop invocation runs in one of these modes:

- **Mode 1: Standard bounded loop** — coordinator selects highest-priority item, executes one iteration, updates artifacts.
- **Mode 2: Targeted fix** — user names a specific item; coordinator validates scope and executes as a single iteration.
- **Mode 3: Debugging** — bug-fix work that does not count toward improvement-loop cadence.
- **Mode 4: Meta-review** — coordinator invokes the meta-coordinator agent; no product code changes.
- **Mode 5: Directed sequence** — user names 2+ specific items to execute sequentially.

### Mode 5 guardrails
1. Each item executes as its own independent iteration (own commit, own validation, own artifact updates).
2. One-item-per-loop rule is preserved: no cross-item refactors; no sneaked-in follow-ups.
3. Scope discipline must be explicitly stated in each iteration's "Candidate Selection" block.
4. If the sequence contains 3+ items, a meta-review is MANDATORY before the next non-directed loop.
5. Meta-review cadence counter increments by N (one per item), not by 1 (one per batch).
6. **Same-Area saturation protocol (MR-004 Change C):** If selected items are all in the same `Area` field, the coordinator must flag saturation risk to the user AND receive explicit acknowledgement before beginning. Acknowledgement must be captured in the opening iteration's "Candidate Selection" block as `mode-5-saturation: user-ack; rationale: [reason]`. Silent "flag" without explicit user response is insufficient — the coordinator must treat absence of acknowledgement as a hard block.
7. **Scope-expansion protocol (MR-002 Change D):** a Mode 5 item's implementation may legitimately expand beyond the backlog row's literal wording ONLY if ALL of the following conditions hold:
   a. The expansion is **evidence-based** — a specialist agent (architect, root-cause-analyst, qa-engineer) has produced an artifact demonstrating the original scope would miss the actual risk surface. Speculative "while we're here" expansions are forbidden.
   b. The expanded work still resolves to **one logical outcome** — no multi-outcome bundles. If the expansion would ship two independently reversible changes, split into two iterations.
   c. The expansion stays within the **same `Area`** as the original backlog row. Cross-area expansion is a new iteration, not an expansion.
   d. The expansion is logged as `scope-expansion: approved` in the iteration log's "Candidate Selection" block with a ≤3-sentence rationale and a reference to the evidence artifact from (a).
   e. The expansion does **not** touch surfaces modified by the immediately prior iteration — this preserves the independent-iteration guarantee in guardrail 1 and prevents unreviewable cross-iteration coupling.
8. **Mode 5 companion-burn-down rule (MR-004 Change A, scaled by MR-005 Change D-2):** If the proposed Mode 5 sequence contains N ≥ 3 items AND the open follow-up pool exceeds 8 at sequence start, ⌈N/3⌉ iterations of the sequence MUST be `burn-down` selections (or equivalent burn-down iterations must precede the sequence). For N=3 this is 1 burn-down (original rule); for N=6 this is 2; for N=9 this is 3. Spacing is unconstrained — distribute within or at the start of the sequence. Burn-down iterations should target follow-ups whose Area overlaps the sequence's Area where possible, to preserve context locality. Rationale: the original "at least one" rule does not scale with sequence length; Path B at N=6 discharged the obligation with 1 burn-down (iter 019) and then accumulated 11 net follow-ups across the remaining 5 iterations — evidence that the rule becomes inoperative at sequence length >3 without scaling.
9. **Mode 5 hard-stop ceiling (MR-005 Change D-2):** If the open follow-up pool exceeds 15 at the start of any iteration within a Mode 5 sequence in progress, the coordinator MUST halt the next directed item and schedule a `burn-down` iteration in its place, regardless of user directive. The scheduled burn-down counts toward clause 8's ⌈N/3⌉ requirement. User override is available exactly ONCE per sequence by logging `hard-ceiling-override: user-ack; rationale: [reason]` in the iteration's Candidate Selection block; a second pool > 15 breach within the same sequence is a mandatory stop with no override. Rationale: soft ceiling (clause 6, pool > 8) has proven ignorable under Mode 5 operating-mode precedence; observed operational floor of 33 (Path B close) is 4× the soft ceiling. A hard-stop at 15 provides the backstop the soft ceiling was designed to guarantee.
10. **Mode 5 sequence-length soft cap (MR-005 Change D-7):** Mode 5 directed sequences of N ≤ 5 items proceed with no additional meta-check. Sequences with N ≥ 6 items require an explicit meta-coordinator pre-check before the sequence begins (Mode 4 artifact, ≤1 page, no product code). The pre-check evaluates: projected pool trajectory, projected area-saturation arc, agent-diversity projection, and whether the 6th+ item could reasonably be a separate sequence or post-sequence Mode 2. This is a soft cap — CEO may override with a logged `mode-5-length-override: user-ack; rationale: [reason]` — but the friction point forces the long-sequence risk to be considered explicitly rather than absorbed silently. Observed at Path B (N=6): 22 → 33 pool growth, 3 CEO user-acks required, reverse portfolio-drift triggered.

## Required Artifacts (Enforced)

### Before Build
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `API_SPEC.md`

### Before Release
- `TEST_PLAN.md`
- `RELEASE_READINESS.md`
- `METRICS.md`

If required artifacts are missing:
→ STOP and request or create them

Artifacts are the **source of truth between agents**

---

## Follow-Up Debt Policy

Every iteration may generate follow-up backlog items. To prevent unbounded accumulation:

1. **Burn-down cadence:** at least 1 of every 5 iterations must select its target from the follow-up pool (items tagged "follow-up (iter N)" in `IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md`).
2. **Staleness cap:** any follow-up not addressed within 10 iterations of its creation is escalated to the next meta-review for explicit "keep / downgrade / delete" triage. No item sits ignored forever.
3. **Follow-up density trigger:** if a single iteration generates 3+ follow-ups, the coordinator must either (a) re-scope the iteration into multiple loops, or (b) invoke `root-cause-analyst` on why one loop is spawning that much residual work.
4. **Density-trigger enforcement (MR-002 Change A, extended by MR-005 Change D-3):** when clause 3 fires, the iteration log's "Candidate Selection" or "Validation" block MUST include exactly one of the following `density-response:` log lines, and the coordinator MUST emit this line in the iteration's completion summary:
   - `density-response: re-scoped to N loops` — work was split; reference the new iteration numbers.
   - `density-response: root-cause-analyst invoked` — reference the analyst's findings artifact.
   - `density-response: scope-guard-adjacent` — the N follow-ups are legitimate adjacencies surfaced by the iteration's PRD surface area and correctly rejected by guardrail 7(b) "one logical outcome" test; root cause is PRD surface area, not iteration quality. MUST include (a) a per-follow-up one-sentence anchor citing which PRD section / architecture-decision / blocked-on-other-item justifies it being a follow-up rather than iter-scope, OR (b) a reference to a specialist agent's evidence artifact explaining the scope-boundary. The per-follow-up audit cost is explicit — this response is stricter than `acknowledged, carried forward` and is the correct option for detailed-PRD build iterations.
   - `density-response: acknowledged, carried forward` — explicit conscious decision to defer without a specific scope-guard anchor; must include a one-sentence rationale. This is the residual option — use when the above three do not apply. Silent violations (no `density-response:` line when clause 3 fires) are treated as a failed iteration for meta-review scoring purposes.
5. **Birth-iter field (MR-002 Change B):** every follow-up row in `IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md` MUST carry a `Birth iter` column with the iteration number that created it. Rows missing this field cannot be selected until backfilled; this enables deterministic staleness-cap enforcement (clause 2) and the meta-review `age > 10` triage query.
6. **Pool-size density ceiling (MR-002 Change C):** if the open follow-up pool size exceeds 8 items at the start of an iteration, that iteration MUST be a burn-down selection, regardless of the 1-in-5 floor in clause 1. This is a ceiling rule: floor is "at least 1-in-5," ceiling is "when debt is growing, force immediate burn-down."
7. **Ceiling-rule cool-off (MR-003 Change B, narrowed by MR-004 Change B, recharge added by MR-006 Change A):** after 3 consecutive iterations have selected under the `burn-down` rule due to clause 6 (pool > 8), the next iteration is authorized to ignore clause 6 *once* and select by `top-score` or `blocker-cadence` — provided the iteration's "Candidate Selection" block logs `ceiling-cool-off: invoked; rationale: [reason]` with a one-sentence justification. This gives the refined scoring formula at least one discriminating selection per four-loop window even in a high-debt regime. Cool-off is single-use per charge: the iteration immediately after a cool-off is again subject to clause 6 if pool > 8. **Recharge (MR-006 Change A):** after cool-off consumption, 3 new consecutive `burn-down` iterations re-arm the cool-off resource, at which point it may be invoked once more under the same rules. Recharge is unbounded — the rule may fire as often as the earn-it cadence allows. **Exclusion (MR-004 Change B):** `directed` selections (Mode 2/5) already bypass clause 6 via operating-mode precedence and do NOT require cool-off invocation. Consuming a cool-off on a `directed` pick produces zero formula-validation evidence (observed at iter 016) and wastes a charged resource — this is prohibited. Rationale for recharge: iter 029 validated that a single-charge consumption produces measurable formula-validation evidence (Spearman ρ distribution artifact); permanent single-use lockout in a persistent high-debt regime eliminates the rule's utility for repeat validation events.

**Testable metric:** over any 10-iteration window, the ratio of (follow-ups closed) / (follow-ups created) must be ≥ 0.4.

## Audit-Intake Pattern (MR-005 Change D-5 / MR-004 Change D)

Audit-style artifacts (e.g., `PRICING_AUDIT_001.md`, security audits, accessibility audits, code-health audits) produce large debt surfaces that would overwhelm the live backlog if promoted wholesale and would break the pool-size ceiling rule's diagnostic value.

Pattern:

1. **Cold pool.** Audit-style artifacts create a cold-pool reference document. All identified defects, improvements, and recommendations are listed in the audit artifact under numbered sections classified by severity (P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 or equivalent).
2. **P0-only live promotion at intake.** Only P0 items enter the live backlog at intake time. All other severity classes remain in the audit artifact as cold pool until a promotion trigger fires.
3. **Cold-pool row tagging.** Any cold-pool item that is later promoted to live must carry `Birth iter` = either the audit-producing iteration number OR `audit-intake` (a canonical anchor meaning "promoted from an audit cold pool"), whichever is most specific.
4. **Promotion path 1 — P0 burn-down creates a slot.** When a live-backlog P0 row derived from the audit closes, the next-highest cold-pool item MAY promote to live backlog (coordinator discretion, or triggered by area-relevance).
5. **Promotion path 2 — PRD-trigger promotion.** Any item in the audit cold pool MAY be promoted to the live backlog if and only if a newly-approved PRD explicitly cites it as a hard blocker in a numbered Dependencies section. The promoting iteration's log entry MUST reference the PRD path and section number (e.g., `PRD_TEAM_TRIAL.md §11a`). The promoted row's `Birth iter` field is `PRD-promoted` with the promoting-PRD path noted. No promotion on implicit or narrative dependency — citation must be enumerated and reader-verifiable.
6. **No other promotion paths.** Coordinator judgment or "we should probably look at this" is NOT a valid promotion path — it breaks the pool-size ceiling rule's protection.
7. **Cold-pool staleness escalation (MR-006 Change D).** Cold-pool items that have been held without promotion for ≥ 10 iterations post-audit-intake MUST be explicitly triaged at the next meta-review. Each aged cold-pool item receives an explicit verdict: `keep-cold` (still relevant, no action needed), `promote` (enters live backlog with `Birth iter: MR-N-promoted` and cited evidence for elevated priority), or `delete` (no longer relevant). This mirrors the live-pool 10-iteration staleness-cap treatment (Follow-Up Debt Policy clause 2) and prevents high-impact P1 items from aging silently when neither P0-burn-down nor PRD-trigger promotion occurs.

Rationale: the pattern was validated by `PRICING_AUDIT_001.md` (iter M3@016→17) where 4 P0 items entered live, ~27 P1/P2/P3 held cold, and one cold-pool item (BUG-07) promoted cleanly via PRD trigger (iter 018, closed iter 023); it was re-validated by `DASHBOARD_V2_REVIEW_001.md` (iter 026→27 intake) where 3 P0 entered live and 24 P1/P2/P3 held cold with DV2-R01 closure creating a promotion slot and DV2-R05/R06 queued for PRD-trigger promotion upon PRD_METRICS_ENGINE approval. The codification locks in working convention; the staleness-escalation clause prevents cold-pool drift.

## Architecture Principles

- **Immutability first**
- **Deterministic pipelines**
- **Explicit contracts over magic**
- **Fail loudly in dev, gracefully in prod**
- **End-to-end reproducibility**
- **Every output traceable to source events**

---

## How to Work

### Before Coding
1. Identify phase (Define / Design / Build / Validate / Measure)
2. Read relevant artifacts
3. Confirm required artifacts exist
4. Identify impacted modules
5. Flag:
   - missing requirements
   - contradictions
   - architecture conflicts
6. Propose approach if non-trivial

---

### During Implementation
- Follow API and data contracts strictly
- Maintain deterministic behavior
- Handle all failure paths explicitly
- Match existing code patterns
- Write tests for core logic

---

### After Implementation
You must:
- validate behavior against artifacts
- ensure edge cases are handled
- update docs if behavior changed
- surface risks and gaps

---

## Quality & Scoring

All outputs are evaluated for:

- completeness
- correctness
- alignment with artifacts
- test coverage
- determinism

If quality is unclear → assume insufficient

---

## Selection Policy

The bounded-loop selection policy is NOT just "pick the highest score." It is a three-step process:

### Step 1 — Compute score

```text
priority_score =
    impact + alignment + learning + confidence
  − effort − risk
  + release_blocker_bonus      # +3 if item is in SYSTEM_HEALTH.md Release Blockers
  − saturation_penalty          # −2 if 3 of last 5 iterations landed in the same Area
```

Scale is 1–5 per dimension. Scores now range roughly 6–18 (was 10–16).

### Step 2 — Apply portfolio rules (any of these OVERRIDES top-score)

1. **Release-blocker minimum cadence:** at least 1 of every 5 iterations must address a current release blocker. If none in the last 4, iteration 5 MUST select from the blocker list.
2. **Area saturation rule:** if the last 3 iterations all landed in the same `Area`, the next iteration MUST select from a different `Area`.
3. **Follow-up burn-down:** at least 1 of every 5 iterations must target a follow-up item generated by a prior loop (see Follow-Up Debt Policy).

### Step 3 — Document the choice

The iteration log's "Candidate Selection" block must explicitly state which rule drove the selection:

- `top-score` — normal case
- `blocker-cadence` — 1-in-5 release-blocker rotation forced the pick
- `saturation-rule` — Area diversity forced the pivot
- `burn-down` — follow-up pool rotation forced the pick
- `directed` — user-named item (Mode 2 or Mode 5)

## CI Enforcement System

This repo includes:

- `.claude/hooks/` → enforcement
- `.claude/bin/` → scoring + dashboard
- `SYSTEM_HEALTH.md` → system status

Assume:
- invalid actions may be blocked
- edits trigger validation
- outputs are scored automatically

---

## Measurement Principles

Every feature must define:

- baseline behavior
- expected improvement
- measurable outcome

Examples:
- time reduction
- error reduction
- accuracy improvement
- process completeness

No measurable outcome → incomplete work

## Current Phase

Phase 1 in progress — **all release blockers closed as of iter 011.**
Phase 2 entry planning is unblocked; no forced-blocker items remain.

**Active work: Iter 030 CLOSED. #51 v2 dashboard analytics instrumentation delivered (Mode 1, `burn-down`, pool 31 > 8 soft ceiling forcing; `frontend-engineer` primary — clean rotation from iter 029 `analytics`, counter = 1 post-iter-030). 6-event PRD §4 analytics taxonomy complete: 5 new `AnalyticsEvent` types (`dashboard_v2_viewed` · `workflow_row_clicked` · `dashboard_v2_sort_changed` · `dashboard_v2_filter_applied` · `insight_chip_clicked`) + `upgrade_clicked` reuse with `location: 'dashboard_v2_health_gate'` value (scope-minimal — zero existing-event-shape changes). ~155 LOC production delta across 6 files (`analytics.ts` +29 · `DashboardV2Shell.tsx` +36 · `WorkflowList.tsx` +19 · `WorkflowRow.tsx` +24 · `WorkflowListFilterBar.tsx` +31 · `InsightsStrip.tsx` +16). One-shot `dashboard_v2_viewed` emission via `useEffect` on first post-load; `performance.now()` in `useRef` baseline drilled through to `WorkflowRow` for elapsedMs capture; `analyticsHealthBand` uses PRD §2.4 60/80 thresholds respecting `isGated`. **Web-app package 289 → 334 tests (+45 substantive `test()`/`it()` blocks satisfying MR-006 Change C D-6 rule)**; workspace **1782/1782 unchanged** (pre-existing follow-up #53 `.test.tsx` exclusion); typecheck clean across all 9 packages/apps. **#51 closed (pool 31 → 30).** D-4 specialist-invocation gate: did NOT fire (~155 LOC < 200; zero user-visible copy strings added — event names and location values are internal). **Cool-off recharge counter 0/3 → 1/3** per MR-006 Change A (re-arms at iter 032 close if iter 030/031/032 all burn-down). **MR-007 cadence 0 → 1 of 3** (next meta-review earliest iter 032 per 3-loop stability floor from MR-006).

D-4 specialist-invocation gate evaluated cleanly: 68 LOC << 200 LOC threshold; no copy strings; neither `system-architect` nor `growth-strategist` adjacency required. Past-cap staleness #1 closed (19 iterations old at close). Pool **33 → 32** at iter 026 close; **32 → 35 at DASHBOARD_V2_REVIEW_001 intake** (+3 P0 promotions DV2-R01/R02/R03 per MR-005 D-5). Cadence counter 1/3 toward MR-006 (Mode 3-adjacent reviews do NOT increment). Cool-off streak 1 of 3.

Core discovery: `packages/intelligence-engine/` already ships `buildMetrics`/`analyzeTimestudy`/`analyzeVariance`/`detectVariants`/`detectBottlenecks`/`detectDrift`/`computeStandardizationScore`/`scoreAutomationOpportunity`/`computePathSignature` — consume not reinvent. Path C Build proposed iter 032-042 (11 iterations) split into Phase A (iter 032-037, foundation; iter 037 = MANDATORY agent-rotation burn-down) + Phase B (iter 038-042, default-pack UI + analytics + flag retirement). **Build entry blocked by 17 CEO open questions consolidated in `PATH_C_SEQUENCING.md § 7`** + MR-005 D-7 meta-coordinator Mode 4 pre-check (MANDATORY before opening Phase A Mode 5 sequence). Iter 027-031 burn-down program unchanged; Path C Build enters EARLIEST at iter 032 post-PRD approval and post-pre-check.

- **NEXT: Iter 031 (bundled)** — DV2-R02 + DV2-R03 under guardrail 7(b) one-logical-outcome = "WorkflowRow interaction hardening" (both live in `WorkflowRow.tsx`, both a11y/UX hardening — native-dialog replacement + tooltip keyboard dismiss). Score 10 + 10; audit-intake P0 burn-down. Pool at 30 entering; ceiling rule still forces burn-down (30 > 8 soft); counts as 2/3 toward cool-off re-arm. Agent likely `frontend-engineer` (2 consecutive post-iter-031, under 4+ rule). D-1 counter projects 2 → 3 post-iter-031 (web-app non-extension); next extension-surface check iter 034.
- Post-burn-down pool (iter 032+): **Path C Build Phase A enters here** if PRD_METRICS_ENGINE approved + MR-006 meta-coordinator pre-check cleared (see Path C Define lane above). Otherwise: #34/35/36 audit-intake P0s, #42 v1 health-score retirement (now unblocked by DV2-R01 closure), #57 v2 flag full retirement (14d-soak + DV2-R02/R03 + #51 prerequisite), DASHBOARD_V2_REVIEW_001 P1 cold-pool promotions (DV2-R04 axe ratchet / DV2-R05 seed fixture + free-tier user / DV2-R06 v1 shadow-function audit — **DV2-R05 and DV2-R06 auto-promote via MR-005 D-5 clause 5 on PRD_METRICS_ENGINE approval**)

Follow-up pool is at **30 open items** post-iter-030 (31 at iter-029 close − 1 #51 closure). Ceiling rule still violated (30 > 8 soft; 30 > 15 Mode-5-only hard, not applicable outside Mode 5). **Cool-off recharge counter 1/3 post-iter-030** per MR-006 Change A (3 consecutive burn-downs re-arm cool-off; iter 030 was burn-down; iter 031 programmed burn-down → 2/3; iter 032 projected burn-down → 3/3, re-armed; earliest `top-score` slot iter 033). Remaining burn-down trajectory: iter 031 (DV2-R02+R03 bundled, −2) → 28 [recharge 2/3]; iter 032 (TBD burn-down, −1) → 27 [recharge 3/3 → cool-off re-armed]. Realistic ≤15 target: iter 038. **D-1 reverse portfolio-drift 5-consecutive-non-extension counter: 2 post-iter-030** (iter 029 web-app + iter 030 web-app; extension-app is D-1-enumerated). Next counter check at iter 034 if iter 031-034 all miss extension surfaces. **DASHBOARD_V2_REVIEW_001 cold pool** holds 24 items; MR-006 Change D applies cold-pool staleness escalation at 10-iter cap — cold pool aged at iter 030: ~4 iterations (intake at iter 026→27 boundary); staleness threshold reached iter 036. **Audit-intake triage NOTE:** `PRICING_AUDIT_001.md` intake rows #34/#35/#36 (iter M3@016→17) age ~10 at iter 030; at iter 032 they will be ~12 iter post-intake and trigger MR-006 Change D staleness review at MR-007 entry.

## Known Issues

- No current Phase-1 release blockers.
- **v2 dashboard NOT externally-launch-ready, NOT #57-flag-retirement-ready** per DASHBOARD_V2_REVIEW_001 (2026-04-21, Mode 3-adjacent multi-agent review). GA at `/dashboard` default since iter 022 ✅; soak window open ✅; but zero PRD §4 measurement instrumented (hard blocker for #57 retirement and external launch). Artifact: `docs/meta/DASHBOARD_V2_REVIEW_001.md`.
- Follow-up pool at **30 items** post-iter-030 (31 at iter-029 close − 1 from #51 closure). Pool-size ceiling rule still violated (pool > 8 soft; > 15 hard applies in Mode 5 only). MR-005 Change D-2 hard-stop ceiling (pool > 15) applies inside Mode 5 only; no Mode 5 expected until Path C Build Phase A (earliest iter 032). **Cool-off recharge counter 1/3 post-iter-030** per MR-006 Change A (3 consecutive burn-downs re-arm cool-off). Projected: iter 031 DV2-R02+R03 burn-down → 2/3; iter 032 TBD burn-down → 3/3, re-armed; earliest re-consumption iter 033. Burn-down trajectory: iter 031 → 28; iter 032 → 27. Realistic ≤15 target: iter 038.
- **DASHBOARD_V2_REVIEW_001 cold pool: 24 items** (11 P1 DV2-R04→R14, 10 P2 DV2-R15→R24, 3 P3 DV2-R25→R27) held in the review artifact per MR-005 D-5 clauses 4+5. Promote via P0 burn-down slot creation OR PRD-trigger enumerated dependency. Most impactful P1s: DV2-R04 axe-core regression gate, DV2-R05 `seedDashboardV2Dev()` + free-tier test user (unblocks 8 skipped E2E tests), DV2-R06 route v1 shadow-function audit (real #42 retirement blocker, not just `computeHealthScore()`). Cold-pool age at iter 030: ~4 iter; MR-006 Change D staleness threshold at 10 iter → reached iter 036.
- Reverse portfolio-drift trigger (MR-005 Change D-1, N=5) 5-consecutive-non-extension counter at **2 post-iter-030** (iter 029 web-app + iter 030 web-app). Next counter check at iter 034 (if iter 031-034 all miss the tracked extension-surface list). Iter 031 programmed DV2-R02+R03 is web-app (`WorkflowRow.tsx`) → counter advances to 3; monitor across iter 032-034.
- Path B CLOSED at iter 024 — **6 consecutive web-app-adjacent iterations** (020/021/022/023/024 directly web-app + iter 019 process-engine companion burn-down). 3 CEO saturation user-acks consumed (2026-04-20 original; 2026-04-21 × 2 for executive refinement + Option A BUG-07). MR-005 Change D-7 soft cap (Mode 5 N ≥ 6 requires meta-coordinator pre-check) now in force for future sequences.
- Agent-diversity: `backend-engineer` consecutive counter was broken at iter 029; `analytics` = 1 at iter 029 close; `frontend-engineer` = 1 at iter 030 close. 4+ same-implementer trigger cleanly avoided across iter 026-030 window. Projected: iter 031 likely `frontend-engineer` again = 2 consecutive (under 4+ rule). **MR-006 meta-review CLOSED at iter 029 close** (Mode 4 governance-only; artifact `docs/meta/MR_006_META_REVIEW.md`). 4 control diffs applied to CLAUDE.md: Change A (cool-off recharge; supersedes permanent single-use), Change B (no-change on D-2 hard-ceiling recorded), Change C (substantive test-case for drift-counter credit), Change D (cold-pool staleness escalation at 10-iter cap). Stability window: iter 030-032. MR-007 cadence counter **1 of 3 post-iter-030**; **MR-007 earliest iter 032** per 3-loop floor. Hard-trigger override conditions for earlier MR-007: Mode 5 start, 2 consecutive validation failures, same-implementer-4+ trip, reverse-drift N=5.
- **Path C (v3 Process Intelligence Metrics Engine) Define lane CLOSED, Build lane BLOCKED** pending CEO decisions. 8 Define-phase artifacts under `docs/features/dashboard-v3-metrics-engine/`. Coordinator synthesis `PATH_C_SEQUENCING.md § 7` enumerates **17 CEO open questions** across 4 bands (terminology × 6 / scope × 5 / governance × 4 / measurement × 2). Build-entry blockers: (a) PRD_METRICS_ENGINE.md CEO approval, (b) MR-005 D-7 meta-coordinator Mode 4 pre-check (MANDATORY — projection is 11 iterations; N ≥ 6 soft cap triggers pre-check), (c) iter 027-031 burn-down program must complete first. Build projection: iter 032-037 Phase A (foundation; iter 037 = mandatory agent-rotation burn-down because 4 consecutive `system-architect` iterations 033-036 would trip agent-diversity rule), iter 038-042 Phase B (default-pack UI + analytics + v1 retirement + #57 flag retirement). No iteration numbers consumed by Define work (Mode 3-adjacent non-counting). DV2-R05 and DV2-R06 auto-promote from cold pool via MR-005 D-5 clause 5 upon PRD approval.
- Path C Define agent-diversity for Mode 3-adjacent work: 8 agents invoked in parallel (product-manager / system-architect / ux-designer / qa-engineer / growth-strategist / analytics / competitive-researcher). MR-005 D-4 specialist-invocation gate cleared for Define phase: new-contract ≥200 LOC projected for Build (triggers system-architect adjacency — already satisfied by primary architect artifact); ≥3 user-visible copy strings across the 91-row display-label surface (triggers growth-strategist adjacency — already satisfied by primary COPY_PACK artifact).

## Compaction Recovery Protocol

When context is lost:

1. Read:
   - CLAUDE.md
   - docs/invariants.md
   - session + segmentation source files

2. Run:
   - `pnpm typecheck`
   - `pnpm test`

3. Verify invariants:
   - constants
   - schema versions
   - confidence scores

Never modify invariants without explicit approval

## Meta-Review Cadence

- **Base cadence:** every 3 completed improvement loops.
- **Increment rule:** Mode 5 directed sequences increment the counter by N (one per item), not by 1 (per batch).
- **Early triggers** (any of these forces an immediate meta-review, bypassing the 3-loop cadence):
  - 3+ consecutive iterations in the same `Area` field
  - 0 release-blocker items selected in 5 loops AND at least 1 open blocker exists in `SYSTEM_HEALTH.md`
  - Same implementing agent used for 4+ consecutive loops
  - Follow-up accumulation > 10 open items
  - 2+ iterations fail validation in a row
  - A named release blocker has survived 8+ loops
  - 10+ consecutive iterations without touching a tracked non-extension surface (web-app, process-engine, normalization-engine, segmentation-engine, policy-engine) — flags portfolio drift (MR-003 Change D). **Test-only touches count (MR-005 Change D-6 / MR-004 Change F, tightened by MR-006 Change C):** modifications to `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` / `*.spec.ts` files within a tracked surface count as surface coverage **only if they include ≥1 new or materially-modified test case assertion** — adding a new `test(...)` / `it(...)` block OR changing an existing assertion's expected value / predicate / coverage. Mock-plumbing-only edits (import paths, `vi.mock` stub additions, harness-parameter passthroughs) do NOT count as surface coverage. Rationale: mock-plumbing edits do not exercise determinism or catch regressions; the rule's diagnostic intent is substantive coverage, not file-level touch count.
  - **Reverse portfolio drift (MR-005 Change D-1):** 5+ consecutive iterations without touching ANY tracked extension surface (extension-app, segmentation-engine, normalization-engine, policy-engine) — flags reverse portfolio drift. Test-only touches count per MR-004 Change F. Mode 5 directed-precedence does NOT auto-suppress this trigger; if the user elects to continue after the trigger fires, the next iteration's Candidate Selection block MUST log `reverse-portfolio-drift: user-ack; rationale: [reason]` as a separate acknowledgement from any Mode 5 saturation ack. The two acks are independently auditable.

After a meta-review completes, do not run another for at least 3 loops — changing multiple control variables more often than that makes effectiveness measurement impossible.

## What Not To Do

- do not invent requirements
- do not bypass artifacts
- do not introduce non-deterministic logic
- do not overengineer
- do not hide complexity behind abstraction
- do not assume missing context

## North Star

Build a system that:

- captures real behavior
- processes it deterministically
- produces trustworthy outputs
- improves continuously
