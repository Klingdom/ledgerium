# Ledgerium AI — Improvement Backlog

Last updated: 2026-04-21 (post-**iteration 021 — v2 Dashboard UI build (Mode 5 item 4/5, PRD_DASHBOARD_V2 §5 + §8 + §9 + post-Mode-3 contract)**); 8 new components under `apps/web-app/src/components/dashboard-v2/` (DashboardV2Shell, CommandHeader, InsightsStrip, WorkflowList state-machine, WorkflowListFilterBar, WorkflowRow + barrel + 3 co-located test files); `/dashboard?v2=1` flag-gated route; 5 UI states reachable (loading/empty/no-results/error/sparse/ready); plan-gated breakdown tooltip with honest dimension labels (Speed/Consistency/Data Quality/Standardization — `FORBIDDEN_LABELS` negative-assertion test enforces absence of efficiency/reliability); positive `'healthy'` tag + `'positive'` chip severity rendered; 4-column verdict grid per PRD §5.3 post-Mode-3; design-token compliance per §5.4 (typography 12/14/16/20/28, spacing grid, radii 6/10, monochrome + 3 semantic hues, ≤150ms motion); typecheck clean; web-app package 11 test files / 233 tests passing; v1 dashboard untouched. **8 follow-ups generated** (#45 system icon mapping, #46 TanStack Query adoption, #47 useSearchParams Suspense wrap, #48 D1 auto-redirect, #49 kebab "Edit name"/"Archive" wiring, #50 D7 "(all-time)" annotation, #51 v2 analytics instrumentation, #52 PortfolioSidebar D5 integration, **#53 workspace vitest `.test.tsx` discovery gap — coordinator-generated from retracted scope expansion**); pool **25 → 34 open**; density-response: acknowledged-and-carried-forward (structural, not pathological — detailed-PRD build iterations surface legitimate adjacencies; several are iter-022 polish candidates; MR-005 at iter 023 will triage aggressively); commit pending.  

Previous: 2026-04-20 (post-**iteration 020 — workflow-metrics engine (Mode 5 item 3/5, PRD_DASHBOARD_V2 §7)**); new pure module `apps/web-app/src/lib/workflow-metrics.ts` with 8 exported functions + 21 named threshold constants; `computeHealthScoreV2` (CEO's 0.30/0.30/0.20/0.20 formula) + `computeOpportunityTag` (Automate/Standardize/Optimize/Monitor/None decision tree) + per-workflow + aggregate functions; 5 PRD §11 fixture archetypes + 62 unit tests + 4 route integration tests; API route enriches each workflow with `metricsV2` + stats with `portfolioHealthScore` + `insightChips`; v1 `computeHealthScore()` preserved per D2 parallel-run directive; 1718/1718 tests passing (+66 vs iter 019); **3 follow-ups generated** (#42 v1 retirement post-Path-B per D2, #43 computeInsightChips staleCount param, #44 route sort params); pool **22 → 25 open**; density-response: acknowledged-and-carried-forward; zero UI changes; commit `afb1250`.  
Current phase: Phase 1  
Backlog purpose: maintain a ranked, evidence-based portfolio of the highest-value fixes, improvements, and experiments for bounded improvement loops.

## Scoring Formula

```text
priority_score =
    impact + alignment + learning + confidence
  − effort − risk
  + release_blocker_bonus      # +3 if item is in SYSTEM_HEALTH.md Release Blockers
  − saturation_penalty          # −2 if 3 of last 5 iterations landed in the same Area
```

Scoring scale:
- 1 = very low
- 3 = medium
- 5 = very high

Higher total score = higher priority. Post Meta-Review 001: range widened to ~6–18 (was 10–16).

### Saturation status (computed over iter 011–016 — rolling 5 bounded loops; iter 015 is Mode 4 and does not consume Area cadence)

- Extension-architecture / segmentation area = 1 of last 5 (iter 011)
- Invariants / testing area = 2 of last 5 (iter 012, iter 013) — cluster cleared; 2 more non-invariants loops aged it out
- UX resilience area = 1 of last 5 (iter 014)
- Web-app UI area = 1 of last 5 (iter 016) — **new entry**; first web-app bounded loop since iter 001, partial Signal-5 portfolio-drift relief
- Session-durability area = 0 of last 5 (iter 010 aged out)
- No 3-in-a-row; no `−S` penalties currently apply. Area diversity remains strong (4 distinct areas in rolling 5-loop window).

### Portfolio override rules

See `CLAUDE.md § Selection Policy` — any of these overrides top-score:
1. Release-blocker minimum cadence (1-in-5)
2. Area saturation rule
3. Follow-up burn-down (1-in-5)

## Portfolio Summary

- Total candidates reviewed: 62 (50 prior + 9 iter-021 follow-ups (#45/#46/#47/#48/#49/#50/#51/#52 + #53 coordinator-generated) + **3 iter-022 follow-ups (#55 gitignore monorepo-pattern fix, #56 docs/features/user-templates governance decision, #57 post-soak v2 flag full retirement)** — iter 022 also closed 5: #47 via Mode 3 commit `6799604` + #48/#49/#50/#52 via iter-022 code; row #54 iter-023-target retained (governance, not debt); iter 022 added row #54 to table during iter-021→022 transition)
- **Next iteration:** **iter 023 = #40 BUG-07 (Mode 2 targeted fix, CEO directive 2026-04-21 Option A)** — `apps/web-app/prisma/schema.prisma:16` `@default("trialing")` → `@default("none")` + `apps/web-app/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts:43` explicit `'trialing'` → `'none'` + Prisma migration + audit 12 callsites reading `subscriptionStatus === 'trialing'`. Unblocks `PRD_TEAM_TRIAL.md` §11a dependency. Primary agent: backend-engineer. Score 11, E=1, R=1. Path B executive-refinement bundle (original iter 023) slides to iter 024 (Mode 5 item 6/6). MR-005 slides iter 024 → iter 025.
- Open follow-up pool (Birth iter shown): #7 (008, age 13) · **#14 (007, age 14 — past staleness cap, KEEP per MR-004 Agenda 3, target post-Path-B iter 025+)** · ~~#15 (006 — closed iter 019)~~ · #19/20/21 (010) · #23/24 (011) · #26 (012) · #27/28 (M3@012) · #29/30 (013) · #31/32 (014) · #34/35/36 (audit-intake P0) · #37/38/39 (M3@016 follow-ups) · **#40 (PRD-promoted BUG-07 — SELECTED iter 023)** · **#41 (iter 017 follow-up)** · **#42/#43/#44 (iter 020 follow-ups)** · **#45/#46 (iter 021 — carried)** · ~~#47 (iter 021 — closed Mode 3 `6799604`)~~ · ~~#48/#49/#50 (iter 021 — closed iter 022)~~ · **#51 (iter 021 — analytics, post-launch target)** · ~~#52 (iter 021 — closed iter 022)~~ · **#53 (iter 021 coordinator-generated)** · **#54 (iter-023-target row; retained as governance not debt — closed by iter 024)** · **#55/#56/#57 (iter 022 follow-ups)** — **30 items open** (34 at iter 021 close − 5 closed iter 022 + 3 new iter 022 generated − #54 reclassified as governance target not debt = 30; **pool-size ceiling rule still violated** — MR-005 at iter 025 boundary MUST triage aggressively; iter 023 proceeds under Mode 2 targeted-fix precedence)
- **MR-004 staleness-cap verdicts (2026-04-20, per MR_004.md Agenda 3):** #14 KEEP (wire `validateRenderedSOP` into `processSession.ts`; Effort 2, Risk 2, Phase-2-dependent; target post-Path-B burn-down window iter 023+) · ~~#15 KEEP (confidence-thresholds extraction; Effort 1, Risk 1; pre-targeted for iter 019 companion burn-down)~~ **CLOSED iter 019 (commit `eca703c`)** · #7 KEEP + flag-for-MR-005 (policy-engine `credit_card` regex; reaches cap at iter 018 → MR-005 will rescan at iter 023). First MR-004 KEEP verdict to close; #14 and #7 remain open, MR-005 will re-triage.
- **Path B companion-burn-down compliance (MR-004 Change A, new guardrail 8):** Mode 5 sequence of ≥3 items with pool > 8 requires one burn-down iteration within or preceding the sequence. Path B = 5 items (018 PRD ✅ → 019 burn-down ✅ → **020 metrics ✅** → 021 UI → 022 polish). Iter 019 = burn-down #15 SATISFIED (2026-04-20, commit `eca703c`). Obligation discharged; remaining Path B iterations (021, 022) can proceed without further companion-burn-down gating. **MR-005 at iter 023 boundary will re-evaluate** whether the post-Path-B pool (projected 25 + iter 021 follow-ups + iter 022 follow-ups) warrants a second burn-down-heavy window.
- **Mode 5 saturation acknowledgement (MR-004 Change C, escalated guardrail 6):** `mode-5-saturation: user-ack; rationale: CEO explicit approval 2026-04-20 for 4 consecutive web-app iterations iter 019–022 under full knowledge of extension/segmentation/normalization/policy surface drought.` Recorded per new guardrail 6 wording.
- **Audit intake pattern (unchanged):** only P0 items in live backlog. P1/P2/P3 cold-pool items (≈26 remaining after BUG-07 promotion) held in `PRICING_AUDIT_001.md`. MR-004 Agenda 1 verdict: **keep, with codification** — audit-intake pattern will be formalized in CLAUDE.md at post-Path-B governance iteration (iter 023+; one of the 3 deferred MR-004 diffs).
- **PRD-trigger promotion pattern (unchanged):** BUG-07 remains the sole instance. MR-004 Agenda 2 verdict: **formalize as rule** — will be codified in CLAUDE.md at post-Path-B governance iteration alongside audit-intake codification (same deferred diff batch).
- Highest-risk unresolved items: **#40 BUG-07 (PRD-promoted, score 11, hard blocker for approved Team Trial feature — post-Path-B target)**, **#14 (post-Path-B target, past-cap staleness)**, iter-010 follow-ups #19–21.
- Last completed work: **iter 022 — v2 Dashboard a11y + polish + E2E (Mode 5 item 5/6).** 17 files (12 modified + 5 new). +11 web-app tests (6 D7 annotation + 5 kebab body-shape); web-app package 233 → 244 tests. 4 new Playwright E2E specs (`v2-a11y` with axe-core, `v2-happy-path`, `v2-plan-gating`, `v2-states`). 4 iter-021 follow-ups closed (#48/#49/#50/#52) + #47 closed by Mode 3 `6799604`. 3 new follow-ups generated (#55/#56/#57). Pool 34 → 30 net. Prior: iter 021 v2 Dashboard UI build (Mode 5 item 4/5) + Mode 3 principal-review correction.
- Last meta-review: **Meta-Review 004 (2026-04-20, covering iter 014–017 + Mode-3)** — see `docs/meta/MR_004.md`. **Next meta-review (MR-005) due at iter 025 boundary** (was iter 024; shifted +1 per CEO Option A directive 2026-04-21 inserting #40 BUG-07 as iter 023 Mode 2 targeted fix between Path B items 5 and 6; executive-refinement bundle slides iter 023 → iter 024). Counter: iter 019 + 020 + 021 + 022 + 023(BUG-07 Mode 2) + 024(exec refinement Mode 5 item 6/6) = 6 bounded loops post-MR-004. MR-005 will re-evaluate scoring formula under-power, audit-intake codification, reverse portfolio-drift trigger, test-touch counting rule (MR-004 Changes D/E/F deferred).
- Next recommended action: **iter 023 = #40 BUG-07 (Mode 2 targeted fix, CEO directive 2026-04-21 Option A).** Primary agent: backend-engineer. Deliverables: (a) `apps/web-app/prisma/schema.prisma:16` `@default("trialing")` → `@default("none")`; (b) `apps/web-app/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts:43` explicit `'trialing'` → `'none'`; (c) Prisma migration; (d) audit 12 callsites reading `subscriptionStatus === 'trialing'` for UI/analytics regression risk; (e) regression test locking new default. Unblocks `PRD_TEAM_TRIAL.md` §11a dependency. Score 11, E=1, R=1. Entry gate: iter 022 validation green (✅ confirmed 244 web-app tests + typecheck clean + 4 new E2E specs + follow-ups closed).
- Release-blocker burn rate (last 5 bounded loops iter 015–020, excluding Mode-4 + Mode-3): **0/0** — all blockers closed. No change.
- Follow-up closure ratio (10-iter window): **~0.100 at iter 020 close** (+1 closure iter 019, +0 closures iter 020, +3 new follow-ups iter 020 — ratio regresses from ~0.200 to ~0.100 as denominator inflates). This is expected during build-heavy iterations; MR-003 KPI target ≥0.25 by iter 018 missed; MR-004 Agenda 10 Signal A proposes revision to ≥0.25 by iter 025 (deferred to MR-005). Path B iter 021/022 expected +0 closures each and +2–4 follow-ups each; post-Path-B burn-down window (iter 023+) is when closure ratio must recover.
- **Autonomous-vs-directed sub-partition (rolling iter 010–020; Mode-3 + Mode-4 excluded):** `top-score` 1/10 (iter 009 aged out; no `top-score` in window) · `burn-down` 6/10 (iter 012–014, 017, 019) · `blocker-cadence` 0/10 (iter 009 overlap aged out) · `directed` 4/10 (iter 010, 011, 016, **020**; iter 018 is Mode 4 overlay, excluded). MR-004 narrowed cool-off clause 7 to exclude `directed` — prevents the iter-016 misuse pattern from repeating. Path B iter 021/022 = 2 more `directed` picks queued. Still below MR-003 band `top-score + blocker-cadence ≥ 2/10` (currently 0). Next cool-off opportunity: earliest iter 026 (requires 3 consecutive post-Path-B burn-downs).
- MR-004 governance diffs applied (recap): **Change A** Mode 5 guardrail 8 companion-burn-down rule (new); **Change B** Follow-Up Debt Policy clause 7 narrowed to exclude `directed`; **Change C** Mode 5 guardrail 6 escalated to explicit user-acknowledgement. **Deferred (post-Path-B):** Change D audit-intake pattern codification; Change E reverse portfolio-drift early-trigger; Change F test-only surface-coverage counting rule.

| 40 | **BUG-07** Remove silent `subscriptionStatus @default("trialing")` in `apps/web-app/prisma/schema.prisma:16` (change to `@default("none")`); update explicit assignment in `apps/web-app/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts:43` to `'none'`; generate + apply Prisma migration | fix | billing / schema hygiene | 3 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | **11** | PRD-promoted | **PROMOTED from audit cold pool on 2026-04-20** — hard blocker for approved `PRD_TEAM_TRIAL.md` (Dependency §11a). NOT a current revenue leak (verified: entitlements flow through `plan` field which correctly defaults to `'free'`). IS a UX-misfire + analytics-noise blocker for Team Trial feature because trial surfaces/events key on `subscriptionStatus === 'trialing'`. |
| 41 | `admin_bypass` E2E contract test in `upgrade-button-error-state.spec.ts` — requires an allowlisted test identity seeded in Playwright auth state; current auth state has only `user.json` (standard user). Extend seed + add 3rd test case asserting `code: 'admin_bypass'` response shape | improvement | billing / quality assurance | 2 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 | **7** | 017 | new (iter 017 follow-up — deliberately deferred per <15-min scope guard in QA-01 brief; completes checkout error-shape contract coverage) |

| 46 | Adopt TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) in web-app — PRD referenced TanStack Query; package is NOT installed; iter 021 used existing `fetch + useState + useEffect` pattern that matches v1 dashboard.

| 53 | Workspace-level vitest does not discover `*.test.tsx` files — root `vitest.config.ts` include glob is `.test.ts` only. Iter 021 introduced the first 3 `.test.tsx` files (React component tests). Adding `.test.tsx` to root include fails because root config lacks the `@` alias (`apps/web-app/vitest.config.ts` has it) and may need jsdom env. Fix options: (a) migrate to vitest workspaces/projects feature with per-package config composition; or (b) switch root `"test"` script to `pnpm -r test` for recursive delegation. Current workaround: `pnpm --filter web-app test` picks up all tsx tests (11 files / 233 tests). Workspace count of 1728 is accurate for what the root config can run but excludes 47 new component tests. | fix | tooling / test-infra | 3 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 1 | **9** | 021 | new (iter 021 discovery — attempted scope expansion reverted per guardrail 7 item (b) "one logical outcome" failure; proper fix requires vitest workspaces migration or monorepo test-script re-architecture; commented placeholder in `vitest.config.ts`) |

| 55 | `.gitignore` monorepo-pattern fix — root `.gitignore` has top-level patterns `e2e/.auth/` + `prisma/test.db` that do not match monorepo paths `apps/web-app/e2e/.auth/` + `apps/web-app/prisma/test.db`. Observed accumulation of untracked `apps/web-app/e2e/.auth/user.json` (Playwright session auth state — **must never be committed**) + `apps/web-app/prisma/test.db` (SQLite binary). Fix options: (a) add `**/e2e/.auth/` + `**/prisma/test.db` recursive patterns to root `.gitignore`; or (b) add app-local `.gitignore` under `apps/web-app/`. Low effort, low risk. | fix | tooling / security hygiene | 2 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | **9** | 022 | new (iter 022 follow-up — coordinator-discovered during iter-022 triage; legitimate security-hygiene gap because auth state contains session cookies/tokens) |

Not iter-022 scope; held out of commit per scope discipline. Requires governance decision: (a) commit as-is under `docs/features/`, (b) restructure into `docs/prd/PRD_USER_TEMPLATES.md` + subordinate design docs per existing PRD naming convention, (c) continue out-of-tree until feature formally picked up. | improvement | governance / planning | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | **7** | 022 | new (iter 022 follow-up — coordinator-discovered during iter-022 triage; no code implication; pure governance question) |
| 57 | Post-soak `?v2=0` flag full retirement — PRD D1 commits to 14-day soak period after iter-022 auto-redirect activation. Currently `page.tsx` branches on `searchParams.get('v2') !== '0'`; v2 is default, `?v2=0` retained as rollback escape. Full retirement removes the branch, removes the v1 render path (~280 LOC of v1 dashboard delete), and retires the flag entirely. Scheduled for iter 022 + 14d (approx iter 036 if loop cadence holds at 1/day; sooner if cadence accelerates). | improvement | rollout / dashboard-v2 / code hygiene | 3 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 2 | 1 | **10** | 022 | new (iter 022 follow-up — PRD D1 post-launch commitment; tracking row so the 14-day-post-GA cleanup does not silently drop) |

Dead-code audit: 2 useMemos removed (`staleWorkflows`, `bottleneckWorkflows`); 4 candidate items preserved after verifying surviving consumers. First web-app bounded-loop iteration since iter 001 (Signal-5 relief). Zero follow-ups. | — (directed, not ranked) |
| M3@016→17 | **Pricing audit + billing revenue-integrity hardening** (Mode 3 — debugging, out of cadence, does NOT consume bounded-loop counter) — BUG-01 (silent `'starter'` fallback in `planFromPriceId` + webhook catch-block) + BUG-03 (silent UpgradeButton failure on admin/already-subscribed) + BUG-04 (missing `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` silent pipeline failure). All three P0 revenue-integrity bugs resolved in one commit.

BUG-01 and BUG-04 regression locks); new `feature-gating.test.ts` (+199, 14 tests: 5-tier boundary + admin bypass + null-plan coercion + quota at-limit / over-limit); `upgrade-button-error-state.spec.ts` +19 (1 new test: 401 unauth). Zero production-code modifications. Vitest baseline 86 → 107 (+21 tests). Scope narrowed from "plans+stripe+feature-gating unit + integration + contract" to "webhook integration + feature-gating unit + 1 contract append" (plans.ts unit tests deferred as non-gap). 1 follow-up opened (#41, admin-bypass E2E identity). | 12 |

## Candidate Details

### 1. Replace duplicated background logic with workspace package imports
- Type: improvement
- Area: extension architecture
- Problem: the extension background layer duplicates normalization, segmentation, and policy logic instead of importing from workspace packages.
- Evidence: listed as the top active Phase 1 priority and explicitly tracked technical debt in the current engineering brief.
- Expected benefit: stronger determinism, less divergence risk, cleaner package boundaries, easier maintenance.
- Dependencies: verify package interfaces are stable; confirm extension build wiring.
- Impact (1-5): 5
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 5
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 14
- Recommended next action: select for the next bounded loop unless a blocking reliability issue supersedes it.
- Notes: this is the best current blend of impact, feasibility, and system simplification.

### 2. Persist full session event stream for service worker restart recovery
- Type: fix
- Area: session durability
- Problem: session data is not fully persisted to `chrome.storage.local`; only meta is stored, which weakens recovery after service worker restart.
- Evidence: explicitly listed in known issues and active priorities.
- Expected benefit: stronger resilience, less data loss risk, more trustworthy capture pipeline.
- Dependencies: storage strategy, serialization boundaries, recovery-state validation.
- Impact (1-5): 5
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 4
- Risk (1-5): 3
- Priority score: 11
- Recommended next action: keep at the top of the queue; likely follows the package deduplication work.
- Notes: mission-critical for trust and recovery.

### 3. Integrate `@ledgerium/policy-engine` into `content/capture.ts`
- Type: fix
- Area: capture pipeline
- Problem: `content/capture.ts` still uses a local sensitivity pattern instead of the shared policy engine.
- Evidence: explicitly listed in known issues.
- Expected benefit: consistent policy application, less duplication, cleaner trust model.
- Dependencies: import path validation and content-script compatibility.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 3
- Confidence (1-5): 5
- Effort (1-5): 2
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 13
- Recommended next action: strong low-risk candidate if the next loop favors a smaller change.
- Notes: likely fast win.

### 4. Add Playwright E2E tests for recording lifecycle
- Type: improvement
- Area: quality assurance
- Problem: no Playwright E2E coverage exists for the extension recording lifecycle.
- Evidence: explicitly listed as an active priority and known gap.
- Expected benefit: higher confidence in capture, recovery, and lifecycle behavior.
- Dependencies: reliable extension test harness and stable recording scenarios.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 12
- Recommended next action: likely one of the first testing-focused loops after architectural cleanup.
- Notes: unlocks safer future iteration.

### 5. Add structured error logging with session context
- Type: improvement
- Area: observability
- Problem: logging lacks enough session-aware context to trace failures across capture and recovery flows.
- Evidence: active priority; consistent with observability-first architecture principle.
- Expected benefit: faster debugging, clearer auditability, better recovery analysis.
- Dependencies: log schema and session-context propagation.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 4
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 11
- Recommended next action: pair with session recovery or testing work.
- Notes: strong enabling improvement.

### 6. Create invariant-focused regression suite for segmentation and normalization versions
- Type: improvement
- Area: invariants / testing
- Problem: key constants and versioned behaviors are documented, but they should have explicit regression protection.
- Evidence: strong invariant list in compaction protocol; high product risk if changed accidentally.
- Expected benefit: protects deterministic core and reduces silent drift.
- Dependencies: identify critical invariant assertions and placement in test hierarchy.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 12
- Recommended next action: consider early because it increases safety for other refactors.
- Notes: high trust leverage.

### 7. Add dashboard-level process for artifact and system-health refresh after each loop
- Type: improvement
- Area: agentic CI
- Problem: the continuous-improvement system needs consistent artifact refresh discipline after each iteration.
- Evidence: new agentic CI structure requires visible state and repeatable updates.
- Expected benefit: stronger governance, less stale status, clearer operator visibility.
- Dependencies: command + dashboard templates + execution discipline.
- Impact (1-5): 3
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 4
- Learning value (1-5): 5
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 2
- Risk (1-5): 1
- Priority score: 13
- Recommended next action: already partially addressed by the artifact pack; maintain as process discipline.
- Notes: enabling layer, not product feature.

### 8. Define recorder failure-state UX for service worker interruption and recovery
- Type: experiment
- Area: UX resilience
- Problem: interruption and restart recovery likely need clearer user-facing states and guidance.
- Evidence: recovery is an active engineering priority; current UX guidance is not yet captured.
- Expected benefit: better trust, lower confusion, clearer error handling.
- Dependencies: recovery model and state transitions.
- Impact (1-5): 3
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 4
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 3
- Effort (1-5): 2
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 10
- Recommended next action: good paired discovery item once recovery implementation is clearer.
- Notes: not the first build item, but strategically useful.

### 9. Evaluate event bundle integrity checks before downstream derivation
- Type: experiment
- Area: evidence linkage
- Problem: downstream derivation quality depends on trustworthy, complete event bundles.
- Evidence: consistent with Ledgerium's trust-first and evidence-linked positioning.
- Expected benefit: stronger guarantees before normalization and segmentation.
- Dependencies: define integrity criteria and failure behavior.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 5
- Confidence (1-5): 3
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 3
- Priority score: 11
- Recommended next action: strong future experiment after core recovery and package cleanup.
- Notes: important for long-term trust model.

### 10. Draft clearer product wedge and ICP narrative for deterministic process intelligence
- Type: experiment
- Area: product / GTM
- Problem: product direction is strong, but the clearest ICP and wedge narrative could be made sharper for future launch work.
- Evidence: current docs are engineering-strong; GTM articulation can become more explicit.
- Expected benefit: better product-market framing and future launch efficiency.
- Dependencies: product-manager + market-research + growth-strategist assessment.
- Impact (1-5): 3
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 4
- Learning value (1-5): 5
- Confidence (1-5): 3
- Effort (1-5): 2
- Risk (1-5): 1
- Priority score: 12
- Recommended next action: run as a current-state strategy loop, not a coding loop.
- Notes: useful but not ahead of deterministic-core work.

## Selection Rules

See `CLAUDE.md § Selection Policy` for the authoritative policy.

**Portfolio overrides** (any overrides top-score):
1. Release-blocker minimum cadence (1-in-5)
2. Area saturation rule (no 3-in-a-row same Area)
3. Follow-up burn-down (1-in-5 targets a prior follow-up)
4. Pool-size density ceiling (pool > 8 → forced burn-down) — MR-002 Change C
5. Ceiling-rule cool-off (after 3 consecutive ceiling-forced burn-downs, next iter may ignore clause 4 once, single-use) — MR-003 Change B

**Within those constraints, prefer:**
1. the highest final score
2. lower-risk items among close scores
3. items that improve determinism, traceability, recovery, and validation
4. reversible changes
5. **exactly one item per iteration**

The iteration log's "Candidate Selection" block MUST state which rule drove the selection: `top-score`, `blocker-cadence`, `saturation-rule`, `burn-down`, `ceiling-cool-off`, or `directed`.
