# Ledgerium AI — Improvement Backlog

Last updated: 2026-04-19 (post-iteration 012 — I1a LiveStep cross-path invariant regression test added; pool held at 11, ceiling rule still active for iter 013)  
Current phase: Phase 1  
Backlog purpose: maintain a ranked, evidence-based portfolio of the highest-value fixes, improvements, and experiments for bounded improvement loops.

## Scoring Formula

```text
priority_score =
    impact + alignment + learning + confidence
  − effort − risk
  + release_blocker_bonus      # +3 if item is in SYSTEM_HEALTH.md Release Blockers
  − saturation_penalty          # −2 if 3 of last 5 iterations landed in the same Area
```

Scoring scale:
- 1 = very low
- 3 = medium
- 5 = very high

Higher total score = higher priority. Post Meta-Review 001: range widened to ~6–18 (was 10–16).

### Saturation status (computed over iter 007–011)

- SOP area (presentation / trust / quality gate) = 1 of last 5 (iter 007) → **SATURATION CLEARED**
- Session-durability area = 1 of last 5 (iter 010)
- Quality-assurance area = 1 of last 5 (iter 009)
- Capture-pipeline area = 1 of last 5 (iter 008)
- Extension-architecture / segmentation area = 1 of last 5 (iter 011)
- All areas clear; no `−S` penalties currently apply.

### Portfolio override rules

See `CLAUDE.md § Selection Policy` — any of these overrides top-score:
1. Release-blocker minimum cadence (1-in-5)
2. Area saturation rule
3. Follow-up burn-down (1-in-5)

---

## Portfolio Summary

- Total candidates reviewed: 32 (27 prior + 4 iter-011 follow-ups + 1 iter-012 follow-up)
- Top priority area: **iter 013 burn-down** — open follow-up pool = 11 items (unchanged net: iter 012 closed #22 and spawned #26), still exceeds the MR-002 Change C ceiling of 8; iter 013 MUST select from the follow-up pool.
- Open follow-up pool (Birth iter shown): #7 (008) · #14 (007) · #15 (006) · #18/19/20/21 (010) · #23/24/25 (011) · #26 (012) — **11 items open**
- Highest-risk unresolved item: no release blockers remain; highest-risk open items are iter-010 follow-ups #18–21 and iter-011 follow-ups #23–25.
- Last completed item: I1a LiveStep cross-path invariant regression test (iteration 012)
- Last meta-review: **Meta-Review 002 (2026-04-19)** — see `META_REVIEW_002.md`; prior: Meta-Review 001 (2026-04-17)
- Next recommended action: iter 013 burn-down — top candidates (ranked): #25 (full-pipeline golden fixture, score 11) · #18 (persistenceTruncated UI, score 11) · #19 (GC stale session keys, score 11) · #26 (I1b DerivedStep byte-identity, score 10).
- Release-blocker burn rate (last 5 loops iter 008–012): **3/3 closed** (Playwright E2E ✓ iter 009; session persistence ✓ iter 010; segmentation convergence ✓ iter 011) — **100% of release blockers cleared**; iter 012 (test-add) was not blocker-bearing.
- Follow-up closure ratio (10-iter window iter 003–012): **1 / 13 = 0.077** — below the ≥0.4 testable metric but trending up. Pool-size ceiling rule remains active for iter 013.

> **All Phase-1 release blockers closed as of iter 011.** The release-blocker bonus `+B3` no longer applies to any item in the table.
> All areas clear; no `−S` penalties apply.
> Items 7, 14, 15, 18–21, 23–25, 26 are open follow-ups (pool size = 11 — unchanged from iter-012 start because #22 closed and #26 opened as the deliberate I1a→I1b tier deferral). MR-002 Change C: pool > 8 triggers the ceiling rule → **iter 013 MUST be burn-down** as well.
> **Meta-Review 002 complete (2026-04-19).** Governance diffs A/B/C/D/E/F applied. Next base-cadence trigger: 3 loops (iter 015 — MR-002 ran before iter 012, then iter 012 counts as loop 1 of 3).

## Candidate Details

### 1. Replace duplicated background logic with workspace package imports
- Type: improvement
- Area: extension architecture
- Problem: the extension background layer duplicates normalization, segmentation, and policy logic instead of importing from workspace packages.
- Evidence: listed as the top active Phase 1 priority and explicitly tracked technical debt in the current engineering brief.
- Expected benefit: stronger determinism, less divergence risk, cleaner package boundaries, easier maintenance.
- Dependencies: verify package interfaces are stable; confirm extension build wiring.
- Impact (1-5): 5
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 5
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 14
- Recommended next action: select for the next bounded loop unless a blocking reliability issue supersedes it.
- Notes: this is the best current blend of impact, feasibility, and system simplification.

### 2. Persist full session event stream for service worker restart recovery
- Type: fix
- Area: session durability
- Problem: session data is not fully persisted to `chrome.storage.local`; only meta is stored, which weakens recovery after service worker restart.
- Evidence: explicitly listed in known issues and active priorities.
- Expected benefit: stronger resilience, less data loss risk, more trustworthy capture pipeline.
- Dependencies: storage strategy, serialization boundaries, recovery-state validation.
- Impact (1-5): 5
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 4
- Risk (1-5): 3
- Priority score: 11
- Recommended next action: keep at the top of the queue; likely follows the package deduplication work.
- Notes: mission-critical for trust and recovery.

### 3. Integrate `@ledgerium/policy-engine` into `content/capture.ts`
- Type: fix
- Area: capture pipeline
- Problem: `content/capture.ts` still uses a local sensitivity pattern instead of the shared policy engine.
- Evidence: explicitly listed in known issues.
- Expected benefit: consistent policy application, less duplication, cleaner trust model.
- Dependencies: import path validation and content-script compatibility.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 3
- Confidence (1-5): 5
- Effort (1-5): 2
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 13
- Recommended next action: strong low-risk candidate if the next loop favors a smaller change.
- Notes: likely fast win.

### 4. Add Playwright E2E tests for recording lifecycle
- Type: improvement
- Area: quality assurance
- Problem: no Playwright E2E coverage exists for the extension recording lifecycle.
- Evidence: explicitly listed as an active priority and known gap.
- Expected benefit: higher confidence in capture, recovery, and lifecycle behavior.
- Dependencies: reliable extension test harness and stable recording scenarios.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 12
- Recommended next action: likely one of the first testing-focused loops after architectural cleanup.
- Notes: unlocks safer future iteration.

### 5. Add structured error logging with session context
- Type: improvement
- Area: observability
- Problem: logging lacks enough session-aware context to trace failures across capture and recovery flows.
- Evidence: active priority; consistent with observability-first architecture principle.
- Expected benefit: faster debugging, clearer auditability, better recovery analysis.
- Dependencies: log schema and session-context propagation.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 4
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 11
- Recommended next action: pair with session recovery or testing work.
- Notes: strong enabling improvement.

### 6. Create invariant-focused regression suite for segmentation and normalization versions
- Type: improvement
- Area: invariants / testing
- Problem: key constants and versioned behaviors are documented, but they should have explicit regression protection.
- Evidence: strong invariant list in compaction protocol; high product risk if changed accidentally.
- Expected benefit: protects deterministic core and reduces silent drift.
- Dependencies: identify critical invariant assertions and placement in test hierarchy.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 12
- Recommended next action: consider early because it increases safety for other refactors.
- Notes: high trust leverage.

### 7. Add dashboard-level process for artifact and system-health refresh after each loop
- Type: improvement
- Area: agentic CI
- Problem: the continuous-improvement system needs consistent artifact refresh discipline after each iteration.
- Evidence: new agentic CI structure requires visible state and repeatable updates.
- Expected benefit: stronger governance, less stale status, clearer operator visibility.
- Dependencies: command + dashboard templates + execution discipline.
- Impact (1-5): 3
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 4
- Learning value (1-5): 5
- Confidence (1-5): 4
- Effort (1-5): 2
- Risk (1-5): 1
- Priority score: 13
- Recommended next action: already partially addressed by the artifact pack; maintain as process discipline.
- Notes: enabling layer, not product feature.

### 8. Define recorder failure-state UX for service worker interruption and recovery
- Type: experiment
- Area: UX resilience
- Problem: interruption and restart recovery likely need clearer user-facing states and guidance.
- Evidence: recovery is an active engineering priority; current UX guidance is not yet captured.
- Expected benefit: better trust, lower confusion, clearer error handling.
- Dependencies: recovery model and state transitions.
- Impact (1-5): 3
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 4
- Learning value (1-5): 4
- Confidence (1-5): 3
- Effort (1-5): 2
- Risk (1-5): 2
- Priority score: 10
- Recommended next action: good paired discovery item once recovery implementation is clearer.
- Notes: not the first build item, but strategically useful.

### 9. Evaluate event bundle integrity checks before downstream derivation
- Type: experiment
- Area: evidence linkage
- Problem: downstream derivation quality depends on trustworthy, complete event bundles.
- Evidence: consistent with Ledgerium's trust-first and evidence-linked positioning.
- Expected benefit: stronger guarantees before normalization and segmentation.
- Dependencies: define integrity criteria and failure behavior.
- Impact (1-5): 4
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 5
- Learning value (1-5): 5
- Confidence (1-5): 3
- Effort (1-5): 3
- Risk (1-5): 3
- Priority score: 11
- Recommended next action: strong future experiment after core recovery and package cleanup.
- Notes: important for long-term trust model.

### 10. Draft clearer product wedge and ICP narrative for deterministic process intelligence
- Type: experiment
- Area: product / GTM
- Problem: product direction is strong, but the clearest ICP and wedge narrative could be made sharper for future launch work.
- Evidence: current docs are engineering-strong; GTM articulation can become more explicit.
- Expected benefit: better product-market framing and future launch efficiency.
- Dependencies: product-manager + market-research + growth-strategist assessment.
- Impact (1-5): 3
- Strategic alignment (1-5): 4
- Learning value (1-5): 5
- Confidence (1-5): 3
- Effort (1-5): 2
- Risk (1-5): 1
- Priority score: 12
- Recommended next action: run as a current-state strategy loop, not a coding loop.
- Notes: useful but not ahead of deterministic-core work.

## Selection Rules

See `CLAUDE.md § Selection Policy` for the authoritative policy.

**Portfolio overrides** (any overrides top-score):
1. Release-blocker minimum cadence (1-in-5)
2. Area saturation rule (no 3-in-a-row same Area)
3. Follow-up burn-down (1-in-5 targets a prior follow-up)

**Within those constraints, prefer:**
1. the highest final score
2. lower-risk items among close scores
3. items that improve determinism, traceability, recovery, and validation
4. reversible changes
5. **exactly one item per iteration**

The iteration log's "Candidate Selection" block MUST state which rule drove the selection: `top-score`, `blocker-cadence`, `saturation-rule`, `burn-down`, or `directed`.
